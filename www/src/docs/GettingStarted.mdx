# Getting Started

## A quick tutorial to get you up and running with CollabKit.

CollabKit is a React comments SDK.

It comes with a few pre-built components that you can drop in to your app to add commenting. Or you can use our React components to deeply integrate commenting in your app, as our components can be unstyled or composed.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to add commenting to your app.

{/* This guide covers our most common design pattern, [SidebarComments](/docs/components/sidebarcomments). See our list of common commenting design patterns to understand what's right for your app here: [DesignPatterns](/docs/designpatterns). */}

Once you complete this tutorial you'll have a fully functioning comment system your users can use to talk to their coworkers inside your product.

Set aside 15 to 20 minutes to get this done.

<H3 className={docStep}>Install @collabkit/react</H3>

{renderCodeSnippet(`npm install @collabkit/react`, [], 'shell')}

<H3 className={docStep}>Import default styles</H3>

In a JS module:
{renderCodeSnippet(`import '@collabkit/react/dist/style.css';`)}

Or in a CSS file:
{renderCodeSnippet(`@import '@collabkit/react/dist/style.css';`, [], 'css')}

<H3 className={docStep}>Add our provider</H3>

Add your app ID and API key to the `CollabKitProvider`. You can find these in the CollabKit dashboard. You should also pass in a user and a workspace object.

{renderCodeSnippet(GetStartedDocProviderSnippet)}

<H3 className={docStep}>Add the commenting UI to you app</H3>

{renderCodeSnippet(GetStartedSidebarComments)}

<H3 className={docStep}>Make your components commentable</H3>

Wrap your components with the `Commentable` component and pass in a unique `objectId` for the component. This will allow users to comment on the component. You can also pass in a title and description for the component.

{renderCodeSnippet(GetStartedDocCommentableSnippet)}

<H3 className={docStep}>Handle navigating to comment pins</H3>

So your users can get back to the comments they're interested in you'll need to handle navigating to pins.

You can do this by passing in a `onPinAttach` prop to the `CollabKitProvider` component. This will be called when a user attaches a pin. This callback should return a `string` that represents the state of your apps UI at the time the pin was attached.

This state will be passed to the `onPinClick` callback when a user clicks on the pin.

Here's an example of how you might handle this:

{renderCodeSnippet(GetStartedPinCallbacks)}

We recommend using JSON to represent the state of your app.

<H3 className={docStep}>Try it out!</H3>

Once it's working and shipped you can ask your team to try it out with you.

<H3 className={docStep}>Customise themes</H3>

You can customise the theme of CollabKit by passing in a theme object to the CollabKitProvider. See the [Themes](/docs/core/themes) page for more details.

<H3 className={docStep}>Generate a production app ID and API key</H3>

When you're ready to ship your app you'll need to generate a production App ID and API key. You can do this in the CollabKit dashboard.

<H3 className={docStep}>Turn on secure mode</H3>

When you're ready to ship your app you'll need to turn on secure mode. You can do this in the CollabKit dashboard.
