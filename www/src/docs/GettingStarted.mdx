# Getting Started

## A quick tutorial to get you up and running with CollabKit

CollabKit is a fast, unstyled, composable React Comments SDK.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to add commenting to your app.

{/* This guide covers our most common design pattern, [SidebarComments](/docs/components/sidebarcomments). See our list of common commenting design patterns to understand what's right for your app here: [DesignPatterns](/docs/designpatterns). */}

Once you complete this you'll have a fully functioning comment system your users can use to talk to their coworkers inside your product.

Set aside 15 to 20 minutes to get this done.

<h3 className={docStep}>Install @collabkit/react</h3>

{renderCodeSnippet(`npm install @collabkit/react`, [], 'shell')}

<h3 className={docStep}>Import default styles</h3>

In a JS module:
{renderCodeSnippet(`import '@collabkit/react/dist/style.css';`)}

Or in a CSS file:
{renderCodeSnippet(`@import '@collabkit/react/dist/style.css';`, [], 'css')}

<h3 className={docStep}>Add our Provider</h3>

Add your APP ID and API Key to the CollabKitProvider. You can find these in the CollabKit dashboard. You should also pass in a user and workspace object.

{renderCodeSnippet(GetStartedDocProviderSnippet)}

<h3 className={docStep}>Add SidebarComments to you app</h3>

{renderCodeSnippet(GetStartedDocThreadSnippet)}

<h3 className={docStep}>Make your components Commentable</h3>

Wrap your components with the `Commentable` component and pass in a unique objectId for the component. This will allow users to comment on the component. You can also pass in a title and description for the component.

{renderCodeSnippet(`import { Commentable } from '@collabkit/react';`)}

<h3 className={docStep}>Try it out!</h3>

Once it's working and shipped you can ask your team to try it out with you.

<h3 className={docStep}>Customise themes</h3>

You can customise the theme of CollabKit by passing in a theme object to the CollabKitProvider. See the [Themes](/docs/core/themes) page for more details.

<h3 className={docStep}>Generate a production APP ID and API Key</h3>

When you're ready to ship your app you'll need to generate a production App Id and Api Key. You can do this in the CollabKit dashboard.

<h3 className={docStep}>Turn on secure mode</h3>

When you're ready to ship your app you'll need to turn on secure mode. You can do this in the CollabKit dashboard.
