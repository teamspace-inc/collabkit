# Notifications

## Get notified about new comments and replies.

CollabKit supports delivering email notifications out of the box for new comments and replies.

<DocDemoContainer style={{ padding: '36px 0px 0px' }}>
  <img style={{ width: 640 }} src={EmailPng} />
</DocDemoContainer>

### Customizing notifications

For our built in notifications you can customise the color and logo.

### Delivering notifications yourself

If you would like to deliver them yourself, please contact us. We offer a webhook so you can be notified about new comments as they happen.
