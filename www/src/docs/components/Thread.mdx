# Thread

## An embeddable, flexible comment thread.

<DocHeroDemoContainer>
  <ThreadDemo />
</DocHeroDemoContainer>

### What is it for?

Threads let users comment and can be embedded on a page, modal, popover or any other container.

Because of their flexible nature, they're useful if you want full control about where comments show up in your product.

### Usage

To render a comment thread in your app you need to import the `Thread` component and pass it a `threadId` prop.

{renderCodeSnippet(ThreadUsage1)}

### Sizing

The `Thread` component will automatically size itself to fit the available space. To control the size of the thread, set the `width` and `height` of its parent element.

{renderCodeSnippet(ThreadUsage2)}
