# Design Patterns

## Some of the different ways you can add commenting<br/> to your product.

### 1. Page commenting with annotations

Great for most SaaS products that have dashboards, tables, and other complex views. E.g. fintech, ops, analytics, hr, expense, payroll. What we've found works best for most products.

### 2. Layer commenting

Great for creation products like design tools. Comments live right next to where they are placed. Just like Figma comments.

### 3. Embedded commenting

A simple comment thread that can be embedded in any view in your app. Great for video sites, or blogs. Just like YouTube comments.
