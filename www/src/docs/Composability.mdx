# Composability

## Combine our React components with your own to create entirely custom experiences in minutes.

### Why composability?

Composability is the ability to combine different components to create a new component. This is a powerful concept that allows you to create new components from existing ones.

CollabKit is built with composability in mind. This means that you can use our building blocks to create your own components. This is useful if you want to create a custom UI for your app.

This can be used for small things like adding your components within a CollabKit component or for larger things like creating entirely new collaboration experiences.

### Understanding our building blocks

To understand how to compose any component, you can look it's Component documentation. Each component has a Composability section that explains which components it's made up of.

### Example

Let's look at how we can use composability to customise a `<Thread />`.

Normally you'd use the `<Thread />` component like this:

```tsx
import { Thread } from '@collabkit/react';

<Thread />;
```

But what if you want to add your own components to the `<Thread />`? You can do this by using the composable components that we provide.

```tsx
import { ThreadRoot, Scrollable, CommentList, Authenticated } from '@collabkit/react';

<Authenticated>
  <ThreadRoot>
    <Scrollable autoScroll="bottom">
      <CommentList />
    </Scrollable>
  </ThreadRoot>
</Authenticated>;
```

This is a fully functional `<Thread />`. It has all the same functionality, but you can add your own components to it.

If you want to add a custom header you could do this by:

```tsx highlightLines="[[5, 5]]"
import { ThreadRoot, Scrollable, CommentList, Authenticated } from '@collabkit/react';

<Authenticated>
  <ThreadRoot>
    <h1>My custom header</h1>
    <Scrollable autoScroll="bottom">
      <CommentList />
    </Scrollable>
  </ThreadRoot>
</Authenticated>;
```

To understand how to decompose any component, you can look it's Component documentation.

### Styling

Sub-components can be styled using the `className` or `style` prop. By default they inherit all styles in the `theme` object.

If you pass a `className` prop to a sub-component, it will unstyle it and you can style it yourself:

```tsx highlightLines="[[3, 3]]"
import { ThreadRoot } from '@collabkit/react';

<ThreadRoot className="" />;
```

If you pass a `style` prop to a sub-component, it will override the styles in the `theme` object:

```tsx highlightLines="[[3, 3]]"
import { ThreadRoot } from '@collabkit/react';

<ThreadRoot style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }} />;
```
