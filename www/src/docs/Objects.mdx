# Objects

## Objects are things in your app that users can comment on.

### Object IDs

The `objectId` is a stable unique identifier for the component you want to enable comments on.

You'll typically want to pick an id that corresponds to the database record the component renders.

For example if you're building a CRM and have a table of customers, you might want to use the customer id as the objectId. For example if the customer id is 123, you might use `customer-123` as the objectId. And for a customers name you might use `customer-123-name`.
