# Security

## Understand how CollabKit handles security.

### Easy to try

By default CollabKit lets you use your API Key in the browser. This is great for trying it out, and early development, but not for production because it exposes your API Key to your users.

### Secure for production

When you're ready to go to production, you'll want to use CollabKit in "Secure Mode". This will ensure that your API Key is not exposed to the public. Instead you'll sign a per-user token with your API Key and send that to the client to authenticate users.

In addition you'll need to create users and workspaces via our API before you sign a key for a given user and workspace.

Follow these steps to enable Secure Mode for your app:

<h3 className={docStep}> Create a production app with Secure Mode</h3>

1. Go to your [CollabKit Dashboard](https://app.collabkit.dev/dashboard)

2. Click 'Create App' and fill out the form.

3. Click on the '...' more menu for the app you just created.

4. Choose "Enable Secure Mode" in the dropdown menu.

<h3 className={docStep}>Create users and workspaces via our API</h3>

For secure mode you need to create a workspace and a user via our API.

#### Node.js: use `@collabkit/node` to create/update a workspace and user

```ts
import { upsertUser, upsertWorkspace } from '@collabkit/node';

await upsertWorkspace({
  apiKey: '<your API Key here>',
  appId: '<your app ID here>',
  workspaceId: '<your workspace ID here>',
  workspace: {
    name: '<Name of the workspace>',
  },
});
await upsertUser({
  apiKey: '<your API Key here>',
  userId: '<your user ID here>',
  workspaceId: '<your workspace ID here>',
  appId: '<your app ID here>',
  user: {
    name: '<Name of the user>',
    email: '<Email of the user>',
    avatar: '<Avatar URL of the user>',
  },
});
```

#### Other: use the HTTP API to create/update a workspace and user

```
PUT https://api.collabkit.dev/v1/workspace/:workspaceId
{
  "apiKey": "<your API Key here>",
  "appId": "<your app ID here>",
  "workspace": {
    "name": "<Name of the user>",
  }
}

PUT https://api.collabkit.dev/v1/user/:userId
{
  "apiKey": "<your API Key here>",
  "appId": "<your app ID here>",
  "workspaceId": "<your workspace ID here>",
  "user": {
    "name": "<Name of the user>",
    "email": "<Email of the user>",
    "avatar": "<Avatar URL of the user>"
  }
}
```

Once you've created a user you can move on to the next step to sign a per-user token for that user.

<h3 className={docStep}> Create a per-user token</h3>

User tokens are used to authenticate a user's requests. You'll need to sign a user token using your API Key.

For Node.js, call `createUserToken` from `@collabkit/node`:

{renderCodeSnippet(SecureModeDocNodeSnippet)}

For Python, install [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and use the following python code:

{renderCodeSnippet(SecureModeDocPythonSnippet)}

For everything else, create a JWT token with the following payload signed by your API key as the secret using the HS256 algorithm:

{renderCodeSnippet(SecureModeDocJsonSnippet)}

<h3 className={docStep}>Pass the per-user token to the client</h3>

{renderCodeSnippet(SecureModeDocReactSnippet)}

<h3 className={docStep}>Your app is now in secure mode</h3>

You can move your development or test app to secure mode by following the same steps above.
