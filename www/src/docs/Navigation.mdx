# Navigation

### Why navigation handlers are needed?

When users leave comments on your app you'll want to make it easy for them to get back to the comments they're interested in. Since comments can be pinned to any part of your app, you'll need to be able to navigate to the correct part of your app when a user clicks on a pin.

This includes navigating to the correct page and applying any filters that were applied when the pin was attached.

### How to navigate?

You can do this by passing in a `onPinAttach` prop to the `<CollabKitProvider />` component. This will be called when a user attaches a new pin. This callback should return a `string` that represents the state of your apps UI at the time the pin was attached. We recommend using JSON to represent the state of your app.

This state will be passed to the `onPinClick` callback when a user clicks on the pin. When you receive this state you can use it to navigate to the correct part of your app.

Here's an example of how you might handle this:

```tsx highlightLines="[[18, 27]]"
import { CollabKitProvider } from '@collabkit/react';
export function App() {
  return (
    <CollabKitProvider
      appId={'your app ID here'}
      apiKey={'your API key here'}
      user={{
        id: 'jane',
        name: 'Jane Doe',
        email: 'jane@example.com',
      }}
      workspace={{
        id: 'acme',
        name: 'ACME Corporation',
      }}
      mentionableUsers={[]}
      onPinAttach={() => {
        return JSON.stringify({
          /* your apps state here, e.g. url, tab selected, etc. */
        });
      }}
      onPinClick={(pin) => {
        const appState = pin.meta ? JSON.parse(pin.meta) : null;
        /* apply appState here */
        /* e.g. navigate to a specific url, select a tab, etc. */
      }}
    >
      {/* your app code here */}
    </CollabKitProvider>
  );
}
```
