# CollabKit

## Composable Unstyled React SDK for adding collaboration to your web app

### Concepts

1. App: your appplication
2. Workspace: the organisation your end-users belong to, e.g. Nike or OpenAI
3. Channel: where conversation happens, a channels is a list of Threads
4. Thread: a comment thread, where a specific conversation happens, a Thread is a list of Comments
5. Comments: an individual message

### Customisability

CollabKit is fully customisable.

1. Easy-setup: CollabKit auto-wires to our backend providing a fully realtime commenting experience out of the box.
2. Theming: You can use our stock theme, or edit theme vars to make it look like your app.
3. Composable and Unstylable: Go a step further and remix our components and override styles by passing your `className` to any component to get full control
4. Headless: Bring your own components and use our reactive store and simple actions to comment, build an inbox, or whatever you desire. Augment it with your own functionality
